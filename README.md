# CS-465 Full Stack Development with MEAN

## Overview
This project was completed as part of the CS-465 Full Stack Development course and demonstrates a full-stack web application built using the MEAN stack.

The application includes a customer-facing web page and an administrative interface, each implemented using different front-end approaches to demonstrate flexibility in full-stack development.

## Front-End Development
The customer-facing portion of the application uses Express with HTML templates served directly from the server. The administrative interface is built using Angular as a single-page application (SPA), allowing for dynamic updates and improved user interaction.

Reusable HTML templates were implemented to improve functionality and efficiency by reducing code duplication and promoting consistent user interface components across the application.

## Back-End Development
The back end uses a NoSQL MongoDB database. MongoDB was chosen because it does not require a fixed schema, allowing the application to scale easily and store flexible data structures.

The application uses a RESTful API to handle communication between the front end and back end. Data is exchanged using JSON (JavaScript Object Notation), which provides a lightweight and efficient format for transmitting data between the client and server.

## API & Security
API endpoints were tested using Postman to ensure proper functionality for `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, and `DELETE` requests.

Authentication and authorization were implemented to secure all endpoints and ensure that only authorized users can access protected resources.

## Key Takeaways
This course strengthened my understanding of how front-end and back-end components work together in a full-stack application. One of the most valuable skills I gained was experience with front-end development using frameworks such as Angular, which has helped make me a more competitive and marketable candidate in the field.
